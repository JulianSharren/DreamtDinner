# DreamtDinner

## Description

A Fabric mod that brings you a small set of food, of moderately higher tier, that only exists in mobs' dreams.

This means, you need to interact with mobs (not players) that can *sleep*.

In-game guidance is available if [Patchouli](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Patchouli/) is installed.
