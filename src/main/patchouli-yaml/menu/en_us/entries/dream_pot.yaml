      You come to activate this tablet for, we believe, supreme food a mere crafter can only dream of. Right?
      Then, get some from $(o)a dream$().
      $(p)Yes, the best food exists in dreams!
      While asleep, living thing tends to see what they yearn for― purified, deformed and idealized in the sea of abstraction.

      Sounds pretty unrealistic, isn't it? Well, correct.
      After all, dreamt things are just dreams, not real. There's no way you can eat such things in reality.
      $(p)Except there is. A mystical instrument, $(o)dream pot$(), will do the job for you.
      This pot connects to nearby sleeping thing,
      peeks its dream and seeks for a meal that it'd crave for.

      The caveat is, daring crafter, the dream of $(o)your own$() is not viable.
      Those who mines and crafts out of this cubic world dream so complicated a dream, that the dream pot cannot seek out its object.
      $(p)The only option is find something else that is sleeping,
      and place the dream pot arount it to take up its dream― with or without its permission.
