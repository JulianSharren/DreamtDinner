      The first dreamer is the one who looks similar to you, crafter.
      They sleep at night in bed, just like you do, and wake up in the morning to be engaged in their insignificant job.
      $(br)Extraction from the first dreamer takes almost one night, but you need $(o)not$() stay awake for that.
      Falling asleep along with them, you'll feel as if the dream pot has completed its job in a moment.

      Can be exploited from the first dreamer. A crafter wouldn't need help from us to make this wheat edible.
      $(p)The dreamer in specific jobs may yield other ingredients in addition to the wheat.
