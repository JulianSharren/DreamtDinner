      The second dreamer is mostly found in the same location as the first dreamer.
      You will need to sacrify cod or salmon to keep them near.
      They sleep in bed in to cases: either by their owner or by themselves.
      $(p)When they sleep by their owner, the dream pot often fail to locate their dream, probably due to interference with their owner's dream.

      The solution is not to pass the night. This is possible if the world requires more than one crafter to sleep, and if you are not alone.
      $(p)The other solution is letting the second dreamer sleep by themselves, which you may have not observed.
      Indeed, they normally like to $(o)sit$() on a bed rather than sleep in it.
      $(br)the key is to make the dreamer tired by letting them up or down a short staircase to the bedâ€• three or four steps would be enough.

      Can be retrieved from the second dreamer. Would you like it raw or cooked?
